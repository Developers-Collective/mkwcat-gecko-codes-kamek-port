# Gecko Code Collection

This is a collection of gecko codes I've created for Wii games, typically the ones I show off in [my videos](https://youtube.com/@mkwcat). Feel free to use these in your own content as long as you credit me!

## Building

Run `build.py` in the root directory and it will build all the gecko codes into markdown files within their respective game subdirectories.

## License

The code is available under the MIT license. The full license can be found in the `LICENSE` file.

## Credits

Various credits go to many wonderful people in the New Super Mario Bros. Wii community who have made and shared tools and documentation. Most notably [Ninji](https://github.com/Treeki), [CLF78](https://github.com/CLF78), [RoadrunnerWMC](https://github.com/RoadrunnerWMC).
